failinator computes statistics regarding the failure rates of various families
of orbital launch vehicles.
It is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2.

The model is that launches of a given rocket family are independent Bernoulli
trials with an unknown parameter p; the prior used for this parameter is the
Beta(½, ½) distribution.  Thus if a rocket has launched L times with F failures,
the posterior distribution is Beta(F + ½, L + ½ - F).

There are two output tools: graph.py and compare.py

graph.py will draw graphs of the PDF and CDF of the posterior distribution for
each rocket family.

compare.py takes two arguments, the names of rocket families, and computes the
probability that one family is more reliable than the other.
Usage looks like this:
$ ./compare.py "Falcon 9" "Shuttle"
(the quoting is necessary for rockets with spaces in their names!)
Alternatively, you can pass just a single family, and it will compare that
family to every other family in the list.


Authors:
Edward Cree wrote the analysis code and added the first few rockets.
Launch record data for most of the rocket families were gathered by Appable.
